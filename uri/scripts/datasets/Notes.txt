1. Paired files generate 1024 tiles
   Crappified files don't generate 1024 files, some of which lack 512 tiles too.

2. Problematic Airyscan files from the server are tossed, name list of the tossed files were saved in separate .txt files. Problems can be:
   - Some of them are too dim to include enough information, for example, signals are too low, most of a frame can be almost completely dark.
   - Some are too small to crop 512.
